# C Programs for FIRST Semester
This repository contains the C programs that I have submitted for assignments and records during my first semester at college. The programs cover a range of topics, including basic data types, control structures, arrays, functions, and file handling.

## Structure of the Repository
The repository is organized into separate folders for each topic. Each folder contains multiple C programs related to the topic. Additionally, there is a separate folder for lab assignments and records.

## Running the Programs
To run the C programs, you need to have a C compiler installed on your system. The programs have been tested on the GNU GCC compiler on Linux

To compile a program, navigate to the folder containing the program and run the following command:
```
gcc program_name.c -o program_name
```
To execute the program, run the following command:
```
./program_name
```
